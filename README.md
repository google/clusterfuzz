ClusterFuzz is a scalable fuzzing infrastructure which finds security and stability issues in software.

It is used by Google for fuzzing the Chrome Browser, and serves as the fuzzing backend for
[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).

ClusterFuzz provides many features which help seamlessly integrate fuzzing into
a software project's development process:
- Highly scalable. Google's internal instance runs on over 25,000 machines.
- Accurate deduplication of crashes.
- Fully automatic bug filing and closing for issue trackers ([Monorail](https://opensource.google.com/projects/monorail) only for now).
- Testcase minimization.
- Regression finding through [bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)).
- Statistics for analyzing fuzzer performance, and crash rates.
- Easy to use web interface for management and viewing crashes.
- Support for coverage guided fuzzing (e.g. libFuzzer and AFL) and blackbox fuzzing.
