  # Default bucket to store corpus / useful testcases found during fuzzing. This has sub-directories
  # for each fuzzer, but not for jobs. So, unless you override this in a job definition, a fuzzer
  # across different jobs share the same corpus (e.g. useful for different fuzzing engines to
  # cross-pollinate the corpus).
  CORPUS_BUCKET: test-corpus-bucket

  # Default bucket to store minimized corpus for various fuzzers. Once a day, corpus pruning task
  # minimizes the current corpus in CORPUS_BUCKET and then archives it in this bucket. You can
  # customize it to be different from the backup bucket above if you want separation from other
  # backup items like datastore backups, etc.
  BACKUP_BUCKET: test-backup-bucket

  # Default bucket to store quarantined corpus items. These items prevent fuzzer from making
  # progress during fuzzing (e.g. crashes, timeout, etc), so we automatically quarantine them once
  # they sneak into the corpus somehow. Once the bugs are fixed, items from quarantine are brought
  # back into the main corpus bucket.

  # Default bucket to store shared corpus across all job types. This is planned for future cross
  # pollination with other data sources on the web.
  SHARED_CORPUS_BUCKET: test-shared-corpus-bucket

  # Default bucket to store fuzzing logs from testcase runs. This is different from the fuzzer logs
  # above which logs the fuzzer run that generates the testcases, whereas this one logs the run of
  # the testcases against the target application.
