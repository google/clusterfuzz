  # Default bucket to store corpus / useful testcases found during fuzzing. This has sub-directories
  # for each fuzzer, but not for jobs. So, unless you override this in a job definition, a fuzzer
  # across different jobs share the same corpus (e.g. useful for different fuzzing engines to
  # cross-pollinate the corpus).
  CORPUS_BUCKET: test-corpus-bucket

  # Default bucket to store quarantined corpus items. These items prevent fuzzer from making
  # progress during fuzzing (e.g. crashes, timeout, etc), so we automatically quarantine them once
  # they sneak into the corpus somehow. Once the bugs are fixed, items from quarantine are brought
  # back into the main corpus bucket.
  QUARANTINE_BUCKET: test-quarantine-bucket

  # Default bucket to store shared corpus across all job types. This is planned for future cross
  # pollination with other data sources on the web.

  # Default bucket to store fuzzing logs from testcase runs. This is different from the fuzzer logs
  # above which logs the fuzzer run that generates the testcases, whereas this one logs the run of
  # the testcases against the target application.
