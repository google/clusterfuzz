# Note that CUDA Toolkit version might work with only a particular version of
# NVidia drivers, e.g. cuda 9.2 needs drivers 396.37 and cuda 9.0 needs 384.130.
# The drivers are installed in
# configs/test/gce/linux-init-ml-with-gpu.yaml.
# cuDNN packages installed later in this script must match the CUDA version too.

# The dependencies installation commands below follow
# https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#ubuntu_1604_cuda_101.
#
# Add NVIDIA package repositories.
# Add HTTPS support for apt-key.
