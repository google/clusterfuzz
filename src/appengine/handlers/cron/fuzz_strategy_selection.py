"""Fuzzing strategy selection cron job.

Runs multi-armed bandit experiments for fuzzing strategy selection.
In particular, this is a Boltzman Exploration (softmax) implementaion
of multi-armed bandit experiments. Queries from bigquery to update
multi-armed bandit probability values based on the new edges for various
combined strategies. In the upload_bandit_weights function, we can change
metric to be for edges, crash, features, or units. Currently based on new
edges."""
