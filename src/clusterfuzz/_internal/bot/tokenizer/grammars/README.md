All of the files in this folder are auto-generated. The only exception is
JavaScriptBaseLexer.py which was translated from Java and is needed to run one
of the auto generated files (JavaScriptLexer). As a result, the code is not
up to linting standards, but cannot be changed. Do not place any hand written
code in this dir, it will not be linted.
