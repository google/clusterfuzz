[1;91m[-] [0mLooks like the target binary is not instrumented! The fuzzer depends on
    compile-time instrumentation to isolate interesting test cases while
    mutating the input data. For more information, and for tips on how to
    instrument binaries, please see docs/README.

    When source code is not available, you may be able to leverage QEMU
    mode support. Consult the README for tips on how to enable this.
    (It is also possible to use afl-fuzz as a traditional, "dumb" fuzzer.
    For that, you can use the -n option - but expect much worse results.)
