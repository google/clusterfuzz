[-] Oops, the program crashed with one of the test cases provided. There are
    several possible explanations:
 
    - The test case causes known crashes under normal working conditions. If
      so, please remove it. The fuzzer should be seeded with interesting
      inputs - but not ones that cause an outright crash.
 
    - Least likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke <lcamtuf@coredump.cx> for troubleshooting tips.
