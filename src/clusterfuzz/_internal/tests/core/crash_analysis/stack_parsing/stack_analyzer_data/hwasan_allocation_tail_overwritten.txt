                     ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^                      ^^
This error occurs when a buffer overflow overwrites memory
to the right of a heap object, but within the 16-byte granule, e.g.
   char *x = new char[20];
   x[25] = 42;
HWAddressSanitizer does not detect such bugs in uninstrumented code at the time of write,
but can detect them at the time of free/delete.
To disable this feature set HWASAN_OPTIONS=free_checks_tail_magic=0
